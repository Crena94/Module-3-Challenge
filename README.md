# Module-3-Challenge

In this Challenge, you'll take on the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of your department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, can you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas?

For this assignment, you’ll sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. Your task is to apply the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.


You’ll create a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for your data collection, preparation, and analysis, including any visualizations. Within the same notebook file, you should use comments and text to document your analysis, including the answers to the questions in the Challenge instructions. Make this report clear and concise. Add appropriate comments to the code, and include any necessary labels for the visualizations. Remember that you’ll present this report to your VP!

To accomplish these tasks, you’ll perform the following phases of financial analysis:

Collect CSV data in a Jupyter notebook file.
Prepare the datasets for analysis by cleaning missing and erroneous data.
Analyze the data at a high level through summary statistics and visualizations, and use this information to select areas for deeper analysis. Specifically, you’ll select time periods in which to identify arbitrage opportunities.
